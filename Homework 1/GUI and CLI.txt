	I have always operated using graphical user interface, so that is what feels the most natural and fastest to use. 
My only experience with a CLI is using command prompt to ping with a website to test my internet speed. I anticipate 
that I will get more comfortable using a CLI as this course continues, but as it sits now, I feel like I am being
introduced to a whole new world of computing. I know that certain tasks will be easiest in a CLI, but the way I use 
my computer now does not call for a vast knowledge of CLI.
